# A Jekyll Demo site

You're viewing example site developed and maintained using the [Jekyll Static site generator](http://jekyllrb.com/) which has the following benifits:

* Fast - No waiting around for PHP to run
* Super Secure - it's just HTML
* _FREE_ hosting using Github Pages
* Automatic WYSIWYG via Prosio/Github
* Powerful templating engine makes site updates a breeze
* [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is fun to write... but you can use straight HTML or mix the two.
