title: Why you should use Jekyll

## This is why you should use the Jekyll

<dl>
	<dt>You get to write in <a href="#">Markdown</a></dt>
	<dd>
<div markdown="1">
Or plain old html or <b>both</b>!

No more bloated WYSIWYG editors to mangle your input. Markdown is clear and easy to read. For the times that you need the formatting control of raw HTML, you can mix them.
</div>
	</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt>The power of simplicity</dt>
	<dd>
		So easy to update. Maintaining and editing content can be super easy... especially with third party services like Prose.io and Github Pages. Even a monkey can write markdown. 
	</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt>The simplicity of power</dt>
	<dd>
		Just enough power to create some complex sites without having to resort to complex interpreted languages. While Jekyll isn't suited for every situation, you can get pretty far with the stock featureset. If you're really ready to get funky, you can dig in and start writing your own plugins.
	</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt>Powerful templating via <a href="#">Liquid</a></dt>
	<dd>
		Powerful and easy to use. With support for partials and mixins, updating your entire site design is a breeze.
	</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt>Blazing fast speed</dt>
	<dd>
		Because all of your content gets converted into plain old HTML, you never have to wait for PHP parsing or slow SQL queries.
	</dd>
</dl>

### Additional
* No more databases needed
* Host anywhere. Never worry about supported versions of PHP, server liscense issues. If your box can spit out HTML, it can host what Jekyll creates.
* Deploy with Git! No more FTP (unless you want to)
* SEO friendly: Custom URLs and metatags.

### So it's all Rainbows and Unicorn smiles?
Of course not. No silver bullets here. There are plenty of sites where Jekyll would be a poor fit. Take stroll over to the [Pros & Cons Page](jekyll-pros-cons.html) and consider yourself warned. Jekyll excells at small sites or blogs where andy _dynamic_ functionality can be handled by JavaScript. Don't throw WordPress or Drupal out with the bathwater yet.
