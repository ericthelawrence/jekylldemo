Jekyll is pretty rad with a responsive Jekyll theme with large featured images and solid typography. 

## Simplicity at its finest:

* Responsive templates. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers. 
* Minimal embellishments. Content first --- other widget nonsense never.
* Large feature images for posts and pages.
* Simple and clear permalink structure *(ie: domain.com/category/post-title)*
